## ðŸš€ What This Project Does

This project automatically **fetches news from multiple high-quality sources**, including RSS feeds from Bloomberg, Reuters, TechCrunch, Hacker News, and more.  

The workflow is simple but powerful:

1. **Fetch & Extract** â€“ Collects the latest news articles from all configured sources.  
2. **Clean & Deduplicate** â€“ Removes duplicates and extracts the main content from each article.  
3. **AI Analysis** â€“ Uses a Large Language Model (GPTâ€‘4o-mini) to:
   - Summarize articles into concise, readable briefs.
   - Rank each article by importance (impact on investors, founders, or tech professionals).
   - Identify key entities and stock tickers mentioned.  
4. **Publish** â€“ Updates a Markdown feed and optionally converts it into a GitHub Pages website.

## ðŸ›  Technical Complexity

While this project runs seamlessly with a single command, it involves several **advanced techniques**:

- **LangChain & LangGraph** â€“ Orchestrates multi-step pipelines for fetching, analyzing, and publishing news.  
- **LLM Summarization & Classification** â€“ AI automatically understands the significance of articles and condenses them into readable summaries.  
- **Web Scraping & RSS Parsing** â€“ Extracts clean text content from complex web pages.  
- **Database & Versioning** â€“ Uses SQLite to store historical data and GitHub for versioned publishing.  
- **Automation** â€“ Can run daily via cron, automatically updating the website.  

In short, itâ€™s like having a personal AI news analyst, working 24/7 to keep you updated.
